# AirBnB-Seattle-Analysis
AirBnB Project from Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Seattle Data Investigation, is a part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Project Overview

I chose Airbnb data in Seattle, and have the following three questions:

What are the most requested neighborhoods in Seattle?

What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike ?

What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb in Seattle?

What kinds of Airbnb homes are popular?

What are the words the hosts and the guests would like to use to describe their houses?


## File Descriptions
Data: 
- calendar.csv: calendar availability of listings and price
- listings.csv: information about all the available listings
- reviews.csv: listing reviews by the users

Code:
- Jupyter notebook.

## Results
The results of the analysis are summarised in a blog post here:
