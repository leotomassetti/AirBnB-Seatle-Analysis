# AirBnB-Seattle-Analysis
AirBnB Project from Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Seattle Data Investigation, is a part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Project Overview

I chose Seattle Airbnb data, and have the following questions:

•	What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb in Seattle?
•	What are the most requested neighborhoods in Seattle? 
•	What kinds of residences are popular?
•	What are the concepts hosts and guests are using to describe their residence and experiences?

## File Descriptions
Data: 
- calendar.csv: calendar availability of listings and price
- listings.csv: information about all the available listings
- reviews.csv: listing reviews by the users

Code:
- Jupyter notebook.

## Results
The results of the analysis are summarised in a blog post [here]()
